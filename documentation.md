# Sudoh Language Documentation
### Preface
This is a (mostly) comprehensive documentation of the Sudoh programming language. Sudoh is a very simple language, and any prior
experience with essentially any modern imperative programming language, especially Python or JavaScript, will make getting started
with Sudoh a breeze.

## Basic code structure
Sudoh is a strongly-typed, dynamically type checked, and garbage-collected high-level language that places an emphasis on code
simplicity and readability. There are 5 types in Sudoh, and they are:
- Number
- Boolean
- String
- List
- Map

As Sudoh variables are dynamically-typed, it is up to the programmer to keep track of variable types and ensure that the operations
performed on data is valid.

### Variable assignment
Variables in Sudoh can be named with any combination of uppercase or lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores, with
the exception that the first character of the name must not be a number.

## Types
### Number
One of the more simple types in Sudoh is the Number. A number may have an integer or decimal values


## Programming Structures

### `if` statements
The Sudoh `if` statement is a structure that checks a condition and will run the nested scope if the condition is found to be true
